# This file is a PAM stack used ONLY for testcasing
# otpasswd while it's installed in the system and
# accessible via system PAM. This allows us to test
# functions which can't be tested otherwise.

# For this tests to work this file has to be copied into
# /etc/pam.d/  but after tests better remove it.

# It's rather supposed to work with default configuration.
# Will easily fail if something tricky happens.
