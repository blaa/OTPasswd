.IP
Skip to a card specified as an argument.
.HP
\fB\-t\fR, \fB\-\-text\fR <which>

Generate either one ascii passcard
or a single passcode depending on argument.
.HP

starting with the specified one
.HP
\fB\-a\fR, \fB\-\-authenticate\fR <passcode>
.IP
Try to authenticate with given passcode
.HP
\fB\-P\fR, \fB\-\-prompt\fR <which>
.IP
Display authentication prompt for given passcode
.HP
\fB\-w\fR, \fB\-\-warning\fR
.IP
Display warnings (ex. user on last passcard)
.SS "Where <which> might be one of:"
.RS 0
number
\- specify a passcode with a decimal number
.RS 0
[number]
\- a passcard number
.RS 0
CRR[number] \- specify a passcode in passcard of a given number.
.RS 0
C is its column (A through G), RR \- row (1..10)
.RS 0
current
\- passcode used for next time authentication
.RS 0
[current]
\- passcard containing current passcode
.RS 0
next
\- first, not yet printed, passcard
.SS "Configuration:"
.HP
\fB\-f\fR, \fB\-\-flag\fR <arg>
.IP
Manages various user\-selectable flags:
.RS 
show              show passcode while authenticating (default) 
.RS 0
dont\-show         do not show passcode 
.RS 0
alphabet\-simple   64\-character alphabet (default) 
.RS 0
alphabet\-extended 88\-character alphabet 
.RS 0
codelenght\-X      sets passcodes length, X is a number 
.RS 0
from 2 to 16 (default: codelength\-4)
.RS 0
list               print current state data
.RS -7
.HP 
\fB\-p\fR, \fB\-\-password\fR <pass>
.IP
Set static password. Use empty (i.e. ) to unset.
.HP
\fB\-c\fR, \fB\-\-contact\fR <arg>
.IP
Set a contact info (e.g. phone number) with which
you want to receive current passcode during authentication.

Set a caption to use on generated passcards.
Use "" to set default (hostname)
.HP
\fB\-n\fR, \fB\-\-no\-salt\fR
.IP
Meaningful only during key generation. Disables salting
of a passcode counter. Enabling this option will make program
compatible with PPPv3 and will increase available passcard number
at the cost of (theoretically) less security.
.HP
\fB\-u\fR, \fB\-\-user\fR <username|UID>
.IP
Operate on state of specified user. Administrator\-only option.
.HP
