- Can pam module use openlog()? Maybe the log is already opened? I guess so...
- Retries
- Skipping
- Warnings when on last passcard
- Printing 'next' passcard.
- Calling external script for mailing/sms 
- Ensure passcards/codes passed by user are in range and won't get larger because of increments.
- Make testcase to check if locking file and then rewritting it has any sense.
